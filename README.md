The MENU section provides links for different features:
'Add a Student' allows the user to add a student by filling out all fields and assumes the student ID will be unique.
'Delete a student' allows the user to delete a student using their unique studentID.
'Display and Modify Students' displays the students as described above and also provides the user the ability to edit any student. Editing students is done by clicking the edit button associated with the student and any attribute can be edited with the exception of the StudentID.
'Detailed student info' displays a table with all students and all their corresponding information.
